# Endee RAG Document Assistant

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system
using vector embeddings and semantic search, inspired by the Endee vector
database.

## Use Case
An AI assistant that answers questions from documents using semantic
similarity instead of keyword matching.

## Architecture
1. Document ingestion
2. Embedding generation using Sentence Transformers
3. Vector storage and similarity search (Endee-style)
4. Retrieval of relevant documents
5. Answer generation

## Technologies Used
- Endee (Vector Database – conceptual integration)
- Python
- Sentence Transformers
- NumPy

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python
